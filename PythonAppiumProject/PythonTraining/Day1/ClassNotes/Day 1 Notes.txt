Program - set of instructions given to a system with some input to get the desired output. 

- Syntax

- Pseudo code/ logical part/ algorithm


syntax part changes when we change a programming language from one to another. but the logic remains the same. 


Rules - 

a. there are no semicolons. 
b. there are no curly braces for marking start /end of a module/if/loop
c. we do not declare variables in python
d. for commenting we use "#" symbol for a single line comment. 

Readable Code - we should use proper space/ indentation
we should declare variable/method/files with proper naming convention
we should provide comment wherever possible.


Datatypes in Python -

number - int, float
string - a collection of chars
boolean - true/ false



Variable declaration - 

var = 32 - > integer
dbl =90.65 => double/float
str="Hello" -> string
flag=false => boolean 


Input from end user - 

var=input("Enter the number: ")
print(type(var))

- string. 

printing to console/ reading from keyboard the datatype which is associated with the value is always a string. 

conversion functions - convert one dt to another

int() - converts string to int
float() - converts string to float
str()- converts number/bool to string. 



var=int(input("enter the number: ")) 

first the input will be read from the keyboard and then converted into an int value and assigned to the var. 


Q1. To Calculate area of a circle where radius is provided by the end user. 

- ask user to enter the radius
- store it in a var- rad
- calculate area using the formula area=3.141*rad*rad
-print area


Q2. Write down a program which asks user for principal, rate, and time, based on the input calculate the simple interest the user has to pay.

principal-int
rate-double
time-int

SI =(p*r*t)/100


Numeric Operators - 


Q3- we need to find the lowest possible amount for each denomination in a currency value.

1$ =100 cents
1 quarter = 25 cents
1 dime = 10 cents
1 nickle = 5 cents
1 cent

$54.78

5478 cents - not looking for this

dollar = 54
quarters = 3
dime=0
nickle=0
cents=3

hint- use division and mod operator
hint- convert all dollars into cents first

- 5478*100 = 5478 

dollar= amnt/100 = 54 
ra = amnt%100 = 78 

quarter = ra/25 =3
raa= ra%25 = 3

dime = raa/10 =0
raaa = raa%10= 3
..
..


Boolean Operators - 

OR, AND, NOT

a	b	a|b
T	T	T
F	T	T
T	F	T
F	F	F


AND 

a	b	a&b
T	T	T
F	T	F
T	F	F
F	F	F


NOT

a	!a
F	T
T	F

Q4. Find out all numbers which are even and greater than 10. 

cond1 = num%2==0
cond2, num>10 

((num%2)==0)&(num>10))


Q5. Find out all number which are divisible by 2 or 3.
