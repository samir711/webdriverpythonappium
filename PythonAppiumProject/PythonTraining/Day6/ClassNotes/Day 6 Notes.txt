Errors -

syntax errors - compilation, program will not execute

run time errors - at the time of execution. divide anumber zero, or trying to access a list index which doesnt exist

logical errors - mistake at pseudo code. logic of the program


Exceptions -

- event occurs during the execution of the program, disrupts the normal behaviour of the program. 

- handle exceptions - by writing code which is prone to exception in a try except block so that the program does't behave abruptly

system unstable
data loss
data to be corrupted

100 test cases to execute

5 test cases required a file. [21-25]

no exception handling for test scenarios which required external file hadling

- only 20. 


- 95 would have been executed if those 5 scenarios had exception handling. 

try:
	//code prone to exception
except: 
	//handle the caught the exception
else:
	//incase exception doesn't come
finally:
	//will always execute whether exception comes or not


Exception as an argument -

Class- blue print or a template from which objects are derived. 
objects - instance of a class. 

objects of the same class are similar. objects of different class are not similar to each other. 


Constructor- __init()__
