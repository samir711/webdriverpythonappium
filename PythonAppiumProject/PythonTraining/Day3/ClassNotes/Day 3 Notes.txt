Q1. for loop for all numbers less than the numerator

and divide the number by them, take mod.

if for any the value is 0 u set a fla to true - number is not prime, else you print the number is prime. 


num=10
prime=true

for j in range(1..21):
	for i in range(1..j/2+1):
		if ((j%i)==0):
			prime=false

	print(prime)

	if(prime):
		//print the multiplication table


Data structure-

a. List - a collection of entities which may or may not belong to the same data type
and it can be changed. 

b. Arrays - list, but allows storage of only one data type

c. Tuple - list, but it cannot be changed. 

d. Dictionary - a collection of key-value pairs. 


Array - 

index- is the positon in the collection which stores a value. 

index value ranges from 0 - length of collection - 1

arr=[1,2,3,4,5]

length - 5
index - 0-4

index-data
0 - 1
1 - 2
2 - 3
3 - 4
4 - 5


Q1. create a list of 10 values, where you ask end user to provide the information. 

the information is the marks secured by 10 students for the subject maths. 

from the list provide the following information -

a. highest marks scored
b. lowest marks scored
c. average of the marks scored by first 5 students


for i in scoreoFirstFive:
    score += i


firstFive=marks[0:5]


for i in firstFive:
	total=total+i

average=total/len(firstFive)

Tuple- 

Dictionary - a collection of key-value pairs.

a key is associated with a value.

key => value 


Q2. Create a dictionary where the following data is available - 

Employee id:[Employee name, Employee Age, Employee designation] 

E001: [Tom,43,CEO]
E002:[Roma, 34, VPHR]
E003:[Frieda, 56, CTO]
E004:[Harry, 52, CFO] 

iterate through the dictionary and print the information as follows for each employee record

ID- E001
Name- Tom
Age- 43
Designation- CEO

key:value

keys-
E001, E002, E003... 

print(empDict["E001"]) 

data=[Tom,43,CEO]

data[0]=Tom
data[1]=43
data[2]=CEO

print( empDict["E001"][0]) - Tom
print( empDict["E001"][1])- 43
print( empDict["E001"][2])- CEO


for emp in empDict.keys():
	print( empDict[emp][0]) 
	print( empDict[emp][1])
	print( empDict[emp][2])
