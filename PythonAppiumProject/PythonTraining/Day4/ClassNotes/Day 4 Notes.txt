1- e
2- l

4- o

length = number of chars

index = 0 - len -1

Q1. Ask user to enter a string, print its reverse. # do not use the inbuilt reverse function if any.


Split and Join

split - is to break a main string into a list of substrings, based on a seperator/delimeter

str="my:name:is:james:bond"

seperator - ":" 

Join - is to take a list of strings and concatenate them together to create a new string with help of a seperator

content can contain different data type 

format specifier

%s- str
%d- int
%f- float
%b- bool


Q2. create a list of 5 string values, print the string which has max characters.

create a list with strings.
we create a var max=0, and newstr="" 
we iterate through the list
and for each entry we compare the length of the str with max
if max is less than the length we assign max the length of the string and newstr- the str data
and continue with the loop


listS=["rose", "liliac", "xyz"]
max=0

if(max<len(rose))
 max=4
 newstr=rose
